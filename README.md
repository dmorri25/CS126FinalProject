# CS126FinalProject

# Project Idea
For my final project, I want to create a game. I have some background knowledge of game development from Unity and using C#, so I know the fundamentals of what is needed. I want to finish this project because I want to go into game development as a career.

# Required IDEs
[GitHub](https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine)
This IDE seems to provide a sufficient GameEngine that allows for me to create a game with a lot less trouble than doing so from scratch. I am really intrigued in testing 2D graphics and this IDE allows for me to do such. 
[GitHub](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d)
This IDE seems to be a 2D physics engine that I can utilize in my game.

# Deadlines
1. Week 1: Have a full planning for the game ready to start coding
  1. Week 1a: If I finish planning the game, I will start coding the Engine
2. Week 2: Create and implement all necesseties in having the Engine
  2. Week 2a: If I create a sufficient Engine, I will start coding game features
3. Week 3: Set-up the game and begin adding additional features to it
  3. Week 3a: If I finish the basic features, I will enhance the game by adding more features and optimizing
